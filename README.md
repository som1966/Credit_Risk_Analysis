# Credit_Risk_Analysis
A credit card credit dataset from LendingClub was used to assess resampling models to predict credit risk.  Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling.  Oversampling (RandomOverSampler and SMOTE), undersampling(ClusterCentroids) and a combinatorial(SMOTEENN) approach of over and under sampling was completed.  Finally, two new machine learning models were used (BalanceRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier) to predict credit risk.
