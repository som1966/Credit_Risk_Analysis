# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
A credit card credit dataset from LendingClub was used to assess credit risk.  To assist with the analysis, Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build, evaluate models and resampling techniques.  Oversampling (RandomOverSampler and SMOTE), undersampling(ClusterCentroids) and a combinatorial(SMOTEENN) approach of over and under sampling was completed.  Finally, two new machine learning models were used (BalanceRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier) to predict credit risk.
